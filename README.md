# NewsMonkey
This is a React.js based web app that uses API to fetch and show the latest news in different categories like sports, technology, science, etc. It has a feature of infinite scroll , it also used material ui and react -router for making it a single page application,i have hidden the api key inside .env.local and accesed it by process.env.local.REACT_APP_NEWS_API
I have taken the api from Newsapi.
